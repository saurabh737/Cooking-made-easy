# Cooking-made-easy

We are planning to build a platform where any user can search for food recipes based on their preferences. To develop this system we are using Food.com recipes and Instructions from Kaggle. We aim to provide accurate suggestions of recipes based upon the criteria defined by the user.

# Steps to run notebook:

1. Create "data" folder
2. Download the following csv from https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions
   a) RAW_interactions.csv
   b) RAW_recipes.csv

Import the files from Database folder in Mysql Workbench for ER-Diagram and Tables/Schema.
